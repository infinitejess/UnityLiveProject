# UnityLiveProject

The live project tried to put me in as close to a real world situation as it could. I worked with a team and a project manager to complete this assignment. We had daily stand up meetings, worked on our own branches, practiced version control/merging code, and had deadlines to meet when it came to our user stories. For our arcade project, I created the classic Arcade game Tetris from the ground up. I built tetromino sprites, scripted their spawning, movement and line clearing. I made scenes for the main menu, game, for winning and for losing. This was my first real playable game built in Unity.
